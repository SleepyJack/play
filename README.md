# Toddler Music Player

A simple, offline-capable music player designed for toddlers (2+ years old).

## Features

- ✅ **Super simple interface** - Large image tiles, tap to play
- ✅ **Works offline** - All songs stored locally in browser
- ✅ **Two-mode design** - Child mode (distraction-free) and Parent mode (add/manage songs)
- ✅ **No installation required** - Just open in browser
- ✅ **Installable as PWA** - Add to home screen for app-like experience

## How to Use

### Live App (Recommended)

**Access the app at: https://sleepyjack.github.io/play/**

1. Open the URL above on your phone in Chrome
2. Chrome menu (⋮) → **"Add to Home Screen"**
3. The app appears as an icon on your home screen
4. Opens full-screen like a native app
5. Hold the top-right corner for 3 seconds to unlock Parent Mode
6. Add songs and set custom icons
7. Return to Child Mode and enjoy!

**Your songs are stored privately** in your phone's browser storage - they never get uploaded anywhere. The GitHub repo only contains the app code, not your music files.

### Local Development

For developers who want to modify the code:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in Chrome or Firefox to test locally
3. Or run a local server for testing:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd /path/to/play

   # Start a local server
   python3 -m http.server 8000    # Linux/Mac
   python -m http.server 8000     # Windows

   # Access at http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Parent Mode

**How to Access:**
- 3-second long-press on top-right corner of the screen
- Visual feedback appears after 1 second

**What You Can Do:**
- ✅ Add new songs (MP3, M4A, etc.)
- ✅ Set custom images for songs (JPG, PNG)
- ✅ Delete songs
- ✅ Toggle "Keep screen on" setting

**Returning to Child Mode:**
- Click "← Back to Child Mode" button
- Auto-locks after 30 seconds of inactivity (feature can be added)

## Child Mode

- **Large, scrollable grid of songs**
- **Tap any song to play**
- **Tap again to pause**
- **Currently playing indicator** at bottom
- **No buttons or distractions**

## Song Icons

Songs without custom images show:
- Random music emoji (🎵, 🎸, 🎹, etc.)
- First letter of song name
- Colorful gradient background

You can add custom images anytime in Parent Mode.

## Storage

- **Everything stored locally** in your browser's IndexedDB
- **No internet required** after first load (Progressive Web App)
- **Songs persist** across app restarts
- **Your data is private** - songs and images never leave your device
- **⚠️ Clearing browser data will delete ALL songs** - only do this if you want to start fresh
- **Storage capacity** - Modern browsers allow 100+ MB, enough for many songs with images

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Android/Desktop) - Full support
- ✅ Firefox (Android/Desktop) - Full support
- ✅ Safari (iOS) - Full support (add to home screen works)
- ❌ Old browsers without IndexedDB support

## Tips

1. **File names become song names** - Name your MP3s descriptively (e.g., "Twinkle Twinkle.mp3")
2. **Use square images** - They look best in the grid (1:1 aspect ratio)
3. **Keep songs under 10MB** - Browser storage has limits
4. **Use recognizable images** - Your toddler needs to identify songs visually

## Troubleshooting

**"No songs appear after adding"**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**"Cannot play song"**
- Ensure audio file is valid MP3/M4A
- Some browsers don't support all audio formats

**"App won't install on home screen"**
- Make sure you're using Chrome/Safari
- Try accessing via HTTPS (required for some PWA features)

**"Screen keeps turning off"**
- Enable "Keep screen on" in Parent Mode settings
- Note: This requires browser permission

## Privacy

- No data leaves your device
- No analytics or tracking
- No internet connection required
- All songs stored locally in browser

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

- [ ] Auto-lock Parent Mode after 30s
- [ ] Shuffle mode
- [ ] Favorites/playlists
- [ ] Volume controls
- [ ] Sleep timer
- [ ] Import multiple songs at once
- [ ] Export/backup song library
